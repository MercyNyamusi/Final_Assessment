Can a class inherit multiple classes in java? justify your answer.

No a class cannot inherit multiple classes due to the complexity and ambiguity that may result when there exists methods with the same signature in both the superclasses 
and subclass. On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority. 


Can a class implement multiple interfaces? justify your answer.

Yes a class can implement multiple interfaces. Unlike in multiple inheritance when a class implements more than one 
interface and both the implemented interfaces contain default methods with the same method signature, the implementing class can explicitly specify which default method is to be used, 
or it should override the default method using super keyword.
